% Given the ODE
%
% $$\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=-4y$$
%
% with the initial condition $y(0)=2$ on the interval $x\in(0,10)$
%
% # Calculate  the  largest  step  size, $\Delta x^{\ast}$,  required  to  maintain  stability 
%   of  the  numerical  solution  to  this equation using explicit Euler
%   method.
% # Choose a step size five times smaller than this value,  $0.2 \Delta x^{\ast}$.  Solve the ODE with explicit Euler
%   method using this step size with MATLAB (self-written programs).
% # Choose a step size $20\%$ larger than this value, $1.2 \Delta x^{\ast}$.  Solve the ODE with explicit Euler method
%   using this step size with MATLAB (self-written programs).
% # Repeat parts (2) and (3) with implicit Euler method using MATLAB.
% # Suppose that you now want to solve this equation with a $2^{nd}$ order method (modified Euler in a form of predictor-corrector).
%   Solve the above equation with the predictor-corrector method and step sizes of $0.2 \Delta x^{\ast}$ and $1.2 \Delta x^{\ast}$.
%   Do you observe an instability?
% # Modified  Euler  method  can  be  used  in  an  implicit  form  similar  to  the  way  of  implicit  Euler 
%   (without doing a predictor-corrector step, but with solving for $y_{i+1}$), since this equation is linear.
%   Solve the above equation with the modified Euler method in the implicit form and step sizes of $0.2 \Delta x^{\ast}$ and $1.2 \Delta x^{\ast}$.
%   Do you observe an instability now?
% # Plot all the solutions, including the analytical solution to this problem, on the same plot-one plot for each step size.
%   Discuss your results.

%
% Investigate the stability of the following numerical schemes for the ODE
%
% $$\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=-\alpha y$$
%
% for $\alpha>0$. Show whether the scheme is conditionally or unconditionally stable. Derive the stability threshold on the step
% size $\Delta x$ if the scheme is conditionally stable.
%
% # Modified Euler Method in implicit form:
% 
% $$y_{i+1}=y_i+\frac{h}{2}[f(x_i,y_i)+f(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})]$$
%
% # *Extra Credit* Modified Euler Method in a predictor-corrector form:
%
% $$y_{i+1}=y_i+\frac{h}{2}[f(x_i,y_i)+f(x_{i+1},y_i+hf(x_i,y_i))]$$

%% Part II: Exploration of Accuracy
%
% *3)*
%
% Consider the following first-order ODE:
%
% $$\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}=x^2-\frac{2 y}{x}$$
%
% with $y(1)=2$. Numerically solve on the interval from $x=1$ to $x=5$ using
% 
% # Explicit Euler method
% # Implicit Euler method
% # Modified Euler method (predictor-corrector)
% # Modified Euler method in an implicit form
%
% and explore the accuracy of these methods. The anaytical solution to this ODE is
%
% $$y=\frac{9}{5x^2}+\frac{x^3}{5}$$
%
% For each method,
%
% * Write the MATLAB function that solves the ODE by using the number of intervals $N$ as an input argument.
% * Solve the ODE using your MATLAB function for $N$ equal to $4,8,16,32$. Calculate the step size $h$ inside the function.
% * Calculate the $E_{L_2}$ error norm between the true solution and the numerical solution for each $N$.
%   Recall that the $E_{L_2}$ error norm is defied as
%
% $$E_{L_2}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum^{N+1}_{i=1}{(y_i^{numer}-y_i^{true})^2}{N+1}}$$
%
% The following plots should be persented:
%
% * Plot your solutions for all the methods (1)-(4), along with the anaytical solution , on the plot for $N=4$.
%   Do not print out the values at your grid points.
% * Plot your solutions for all the methods (1)-(4), along with the anaytical solution , on the plot for $N=32$.
%   Do not print out the values at your grid points.
% * Plot the values of the $E_{L_2}$ error norm for all the methods (1)-(4), as a function of $N$ on the same plot,
%   in log-log scale. Estimate the order of convergence for each method from this plot.
